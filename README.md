# telegram-instagram-dl
This project uses instagrapi and python-telegram-bot to download posts from public Instagram accounts!

To get started, you will need to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Then, you will need to enter a username and password, along with your telegram bot token from botfather, into the creds.json file.
Once you have that, simply run 'python3 app.py' to run!
