# telegram-media-dl
This project uses instagrapi and python-telegram-bot to download content from various social media!

To get started, you will need to run 'pip install -r requirements.txt'. Then, you will need to enter an instagram username and password, along with your telegram bot token from botfather, into the creds.json file.
Once you have that, simply run 'python3 app.py' to run!

Currently, only instagram has a sign in feature and it's required to sign in to use the instagram download feature at all.

Current features:
- [x] Download images, videos, reels, and galleries from public Instagram accounts
- [x] Download stories and highlights from public Instagram accounts
- [x] Download posts from private Instagram accounts
- [x] Download TikTok posts (without watermarks!)
- [x] Download YouTube videos (with sponsorblock segments marked) (limited to 50mb uploads unless you use a [custom api server](https://github.com/tdlib/telegram-bot-api))
- [x] Download Reddit images, videos and galleries
